PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net NX_STATE_reg_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin NX_STATE_reg_LDC_i_1/O, cell NX_STATE_reg_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net p_13_out[7] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin sw_reg[6]_i_2/O, cell sw_reg[6]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
