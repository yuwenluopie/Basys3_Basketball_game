# CE339 Lab2_2_2 Create a two-bit wide 2-to-1 multiplexer using dataflow modeling.

#### By _**{Yu Wenlu wy19403@essex.ac.uk}**_

### This project is an assignment submission for the CE339 High Level Digital Design


## Technologies Used

* _Simulation system: Vivado 2021.2_
* _Target hardware: a Digilent Basys3 board with a Xilinx FPGA: xc7a35tcpg236-1_
* _Programming languages: VHDL, C_


## Description
This implements a 2-to-1 multiplexer (mux) function for two-bit vectors. The input signals to the circuit are x, s, and y, and the output signal is m.

The x and y inputs are two-bit vectors, and the s input is a two-bit vector that selects one of the two inputs. The output m is also a two-bit vector.

The mux function is defined in the Behavioral architecture of the entity lab2_2_2. It takes the inputs x and s as inputs, performs a logical AND operation on x and the negation of s, and performs a logical OR operation on the result and the product of s and y. The output m is assigned the value of the logical OR operation.

This circuit implements a 4-to-2 mux, which selects one of four possible 2-bit inputs, x and y, based on the value of the 2-bit select signal s.
