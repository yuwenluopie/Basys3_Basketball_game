### This project is an assignment submission for the CE339 High Level Digital Design


## Technologies Used

* _Simulation system: Vivado 2021.2_
* _Target hardware: a Digilent Basys3 board with a Xilinx FPGA: xc7a35tcpg236-1_
* _Programming languages: VHDL, C_


## Description
The input signals to the circuit are x, y, and s, and the output signal is m.

The x and y inputs are two-bit vectors, and the s input is a single-bit signal that selects one of the two inputs. The output m is also a two-bit vector.

The mux function is defined in the Behavioral architecture of the entity lab2_2_3. It uses the VHDL WHEN-ELSE statement to implement the mux function. If s is logic 0, m is equal to x. If s is logic 1, m is equal to y. If s is neither 0 nor 1, m is assigned the value "00" after a delay of 3 ns.

This circuit implements a 2-to-1 mux, which selects one of two possible 2-bit inputs, x and y, based on the value of the single-bit select signal s.
