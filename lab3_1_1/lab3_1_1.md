# CE339 Lab3_1_1 Define a 4-bit number in the model and display it on the right most 7-segment display.

#### By _**{Yu Wenlu wy19403@essex.ac.uk}**_

### This project is an assignment submission for the CE339 High Level Digital Design


## Technologies Used

* _Simulation system: Vivado 2021.2_
* _Target hardware: a Digilent Basys3 board with a Xilinx FPGA: xc7a35tcpg236-1_
* _Programming languages: VHDL, C_


## Description
This describes an entity called "right_most_7segment_display" that is used to display the right-most digit on a seven-segment display. The entity has three inputs: x, an, and seg. "x" is a 4-bit binary-coded decimal (BCD) number that represents the digit to be displayed. "an" is the active-low digit select signal that indicates which digit is currently selected to be displayed. "seg" is the 7-bit output signal that drives the segments of the seven-segment display.

In the architecture, the active-low digit select signal is set to "1110", indicating that the right-most digit is selected. The "WITH x SELECT" statement maps the BCD input to the corresponding seven-segment display pattern. If the input "x" is "0000", the output "seg" is set to "1000000". If the input is "0001", the output is set to "1111001", and so on. The "WHEN OTHERS" clause sets the output to "1111111" for all other inputs.
